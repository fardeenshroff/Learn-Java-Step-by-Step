2. Open Terminal and check if Java is installed:  
   ```
   java -version
   ```
3. If Java is not installed, install it via Homebrew:
   ```
   brew install openjdk@17
   ```
4. Set the environment variable:
   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```

### Windows:
1. Download and install the latest version of JDK from the [Oracle JDK page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable:
   - Right-click on **This PC** â†’ **Properties** â†’ **Advanced system settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**.
   - Add a new system variable:  
     `JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`
   - Update the `Path` variable to include `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`.

### Linux:
1. Open a terminal and install the latest version of JDK using APT:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
   ```
